# Some Information
This is just a simple user agent parser I made because I was bored
It only works on Windows :(

## Installation
py -m pip install os" and "py -m pip install httpagentparser" then run main.py and you are done :)

### Usage
curl "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BeetleJuiceDiscord/User-Agent-Parser/main/main.py" --output main.py & cls & python main.py
